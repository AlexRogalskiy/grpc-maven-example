## Client Server Communication with gRPC 


This is an example project to try out gRPC. 

It's a simple Java project build with maven to demonstrate how to perform 
communication between the client and server using gRPC. 

I am keeping only the most needed dependencies required to build the classes from the protobuf service 
definition i.e the `.proto` file. 

I am using protobuf version 3 to define the `.proto` file.
